# CMPSC465-Project3
Takes in a file that has a number that lists the dimensions of a board that contains X's and O's. Any group of O's that is surrounded by X's gets converted to an X. If an O or group of O's is not surrounded by an X's on all sides (i.e. an O that lies along an edge), than it stays as an O.
